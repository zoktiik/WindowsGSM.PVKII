### WindowsGSM.PVKII
---
Basically a simple plugin to add an obscure Source game's Dedicated Server software. I wanted to quickly throw this plugin together after struggling to make one for Dystopia Dedicated Server using WindowsGSM's inbuilt `Source` class, with a huge roadblock being the game's non-standard `srcds` location. PVKII DS does not suffer from this issue, and so this serves as a proof of concept for simple plugins that support (conformant) Source servers.
